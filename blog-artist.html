<hr>

<p class="custom-font">Nathan John Feuerstein (born March 30, 1991), known by his initials NF (stylized as Ð˜F), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. He has released two EPs, I'm Free (2012), and a self-titled EP in 2014 with Capitol CMG. His second and first major-label studio album, Mansion, was released on March 31, 2015. His third studio album, Therapy Session, was released on April 22, 2016, and peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard 200. His albums have earned several accolades, some of which include the Gospel Music Association Dove Award for Rap/Hip Hop Album of the Year (Therapy Session) in 2016 and the Rap/Hip Hop Recorded Song of the Year (Oh Lord) in 2017.</p>

<p class="custom-font">NF achieved mainstream popularity in 2017 with Perception; the album charted at number one in the United States and was certified platinum, while its third single, "Let You Down", reached number twelve on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was a top-ten hit internationally. He achieved similar commercial success with his follow up The Search (2019). Clouds was released in 2021.

<h2 class="custom-text1">Early Life</h2>

<hr>

<p class="custom-font">Nathan John Feuerstein was born in Gladwin, Michigan, on March 30, 1991. He is the eldest of three and has two sisters. His parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother until his father had to take him away when her boyfriend abused him and one of his sisters. His mother died from an overdose of opioids in 2009, which led to him dedicating the song "How Could You Leave Us" to her. He graduated from Gladwin High School in 2009, and was on the school's basketball team. NF started his career at the Fine Arts Festival, organized by Connection Church in Canton, Michigan.</p>
