<h2 class="tv-subheading">About the Show</h2>

<hr>
<br>
<p class="tv-p3">The Walking Dead (TWD) is an American post-apocalyptic horror drama television series developed by Frank Darabont, based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. Together, the show and the comic book series form the core of The Walking Dead franchise. The series features a large ensemble cast as survivors of a zombie apocalypse trying to stay alive under near-constant threat of attacks from zombies known as "walkers". With the collapse of modern civilization, these survivors must confront other human survivors who have formed groups and communities with their own sets of laws and morals, sometimes leading to open conflict between them. The series is the first television series within The Walking Dead franchise.</p>

<h2 class="tv-subheading">Why is The Walking Dead my favourite TV Show?</h2>

<hr>
<br>
<p class="tv-p3">I've always liked apocolytic movies and tv shows but <span class="special-text">The Walking Dead</span> is by far the best I've seen to date. This show is not just about 'zombies', it captures what it's like to survive, to protect the ones you love and it teaches valuable life lessons. I especially love the character development, people like Carol and Daryl grow in such unexpected ways and writing makes you care about them deeply. The show is unpredictable and emotional. Sure, it has gory scenes, but the deeper message and the way it mirrors realistic human behavior in crisis makes it unforgettable. It’s the kind of show that sticks with you and makes you think, <span class="special-text"> what would I do if everything collapsed tomorrow?</span></p>
